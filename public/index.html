                <p>As a lover of all things beer, this project was a blast to be a part of! Our team had the opportunity to built the digital version of the Inland Northwest Ale Trail’s paper map, where visitors collect stamps from breweries towards the redemption of a free mini-growler. From a technology standpoint, this was a lot of fun to build.</p>
                <p>I was responsible for building the API that feeds the brewery information and user data to and from the app. We leveraged Craft CMS as the means to input and manage content in tandem with the Craft Element API and a custom back-end plugin to make the magic happen. I also worked with React Native to build and compile the native iOS application.</p>

                <p><strong>accesso</strong> was looking to give their web presence a visual facelift. We worked in harmony with their design partner to develop and deliver a modular, front-end component library that could be used to build complex, yet flexible, layouts. The component library serves as a living styleguide to ensure visual consistency when new content and layouts are created and proved essential for creating flexible, reusable <strong>Craft CMS</strong> templates.</p>
                <p>This project offered some unique challenges to overcome, such as the ability to create complex modules in the CMS with control over everything from SVG icons that could be color-controlled to full-bleed interactive image carousels that are usable on everything from mobile devices to widescreen desktop computers.</p>
